# big-data-challenge

My jupyter lab notebooks can be found in the "level-1" folder, along with my SQL [schema](https://github.com/mbruns13/big-data-challenge/blob/main/level-1/schema.sql) and [test queries](https://github.com/mbruns13/big-data-challenge/blob/main/level-1/test_queries.sql) I ran to check that the data had been loaded in properly. 

The csv files in the [query_results](https://github.com/mbruns13/big-data-challenge/tree/main/level-1/query_results) folder are the saved results from the queries run in test_queries.sql (in order to show that the data was loaded into the tables).
